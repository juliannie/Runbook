- Web: Next.js (App Router), React Server Components where possible, Tailwind, TanStack Query.
- Mobile: React Native (Expo), React Navigation, TanStack Query.
- Keep components pure; extract data fetching to hooks/services.
- Memoize lists; lazy-load heavy routes/screens.
- Use semantic HTML, aria attributes, and responsive design on web.
- Forms: react-hook-form + Zod with field-level errors.
