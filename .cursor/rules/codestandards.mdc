- Use TypeScript with "strict": true. No `any`.
- Use functional components and hooks only.
- State: Local → component; server cache → TanStack Query; cross-component → Zustand/Context.
- Forms: react-hook-form + Zod resolvers.
- Commits: Conventional Commits.
- Modules must be single-responsibility and maintainable.
